# JobBoard Documentation

## Overview

JobBoard is an application designed to streamline the process of job applications by providing a platform for employers to create job application forms and for candidates to submit their applications. This documentation provides an overview of the JobBoard application, its architecture, functionality, and testing approach.

## Project Structure

The JobBoard solution consists of two main projects:

1. **JobBoard**: This is the main application project that contains the implementation of the JobBoard application. It includes various components such as services, models, controllers, and utilities.
2. **JobBoard.Tests**: This project contains unit tests for the services and components of the JobBoard application. It ensures that each component functions correctly and adheres to its specified behavior.

## JobBoard Project

### Components

- **Controllers**: Contains the ASP.NET Core MVC controllers responsible for handling HTTP requests and generating HTTP responses.
- **Models**: Defines the data models used throughout the application.
- **Services**: Contains the business logic and functionality of the application, including CRUD operations, data manipulation, and integration with external services.
- **Utility**: Provides utility classes and helper functions used across the application, such as mapping DTOs to models and vice versa.

### Dependencies

The JobBoard project depends on the following libraries and frameworks:

- **ASP.NET Core MVC**: Provides the web framework for building web APIs and web applications.
- **Azure Cosmos DB SDK**: Used for interacting with Azure Cosmos DB, a NoSQL database used for storing application data.
- **Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Abstractions**: Provides abstractions for configuration settings.
- **Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions**: Provides abstractions for logging functionality.

### Configuration

The JobBoard application utilizes configuration settings stored in `appsettings.json` and or environment variables. These settings include database connection strings, logging configuration, and other application-specific settings.

### Testing

The JobBoard project includes unit tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of its components. These tests are located in the JobBoard.Tests project and cover various aspects of the application, including services, controllers, and utility classes.

## JobBoard.Tests Project

### Tests

The JobBoard.Tests project contains unit tests for the services and components of the JobBoard application. Each test file corresponds to a specific component or functionality of the application.

### Dependencies

The JobBoard.Tests project depends on the following libraries and frameworks:

- **xUnit**: Used as the unit testing framework for writing and executing unit tests.
- **Moq**: Used for creating mock objects and setting up behavior for dependencies in unit tests.
- **Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Abstractions**: Provides abstractions for configuration settings.
- **Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Abstractions**: Provides abstractions for logging functionality.

### Running Tests

To run the unit tests in the JobBoard.Tests project:

1. Ensure that the JobBoard application is built and running correctly.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio or any compatible IDE.
3. Build the solution to ensure that all projects are up to date.
4. Open the Test Explorer window in Visual Studio.
5. Click on "Run All" to execute all unit tests in the solution.
6. Alternatively, individual unit tests can be executed by selecting them and clicking on "Run Selected Tests".
